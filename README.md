Hello,

I'm currenlty a scientist in training persuing a PhD in Computational (Biophysics & Physical Chemistry).

My Research is specifically aimed at investigating the ion permeation mechanisms which pose a crucial function for most biological cells.
In fact, ion channels (the membrane embedded proteins that mediate the permeation of ions) are older than multi-cellularism, and are thus critical to the function of cells as we know them. 
At this time I am investigating the ability of different computational force-fields to capture various phemomena that underpin the permeation mechanisms.

My interests are vaired but the ones that burn the brightest are:

- Computation and Computational Physics
- Life, particularly cognition, conciousness and the general (yet unqiue) experience of what it is like to "be".
- Systems, simulations, celluar automata and things of that nature.
